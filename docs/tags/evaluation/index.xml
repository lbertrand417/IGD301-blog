      <description>Locomotion technique evaluation The last step is to evaluate my locomotion technique. For this purpose, I asked 3 people to test it and I myself took part in the evaluation. The test session went as follows: a first phase of discovery, during which the player tests the locomotion (I don&amp;rsquo;t answer questions, they must discover by themselves). It lasts about 2 to 3 minutes. Then, follows a 10-minute test phase during which the player must complete the course, as many times as he wants, as quickly as possible and by catching as many coins as possible.</description>
