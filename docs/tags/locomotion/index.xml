      <description>Locomotion technique evaluation The last step is to evaluate my locomotion technique. For this purpose, I asked 3 people to test it and I myself took part in the evaluation. The test session went as follows: a first phase of discovery, during which the player tests the locomotion (I don&amp;rsquo;t answer questions, they must discover by themselves). It lasts about 2 to 3 minutes. Then, follows a 10-minute test phase during which the player must complete the course, as many times as he wants, as quickly as possible and by catching as many coins as possible.</description>

      <description>Today I planned to correct the trigger problem (you can bring the ball back in your hand or change it even when the ball is thrown). For that, I added a boolean which is true when the ball is thrown and which blocks the AttachBall() and ChangeBall() functions.
I also tried to allow the user to change the hand. My idea is that each controller has a MySelect.cs script and that in LocomotionTechnique we disable/enable one or the other depending on the user&amp;rsquo;s actions.</description>

      <description>Today my goal is to solve the problems with the coins and banners and to add the bouncing ball. As a reminder, currently the balls collide with the coins. This is a problem because the coins are not supposed to be solid, and also because when you use the sticky ball you teleport onto the coin. Since the locomotion is done with the ball, I decided that the ball represents the movement of the user.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to get back to the project. As described in the previous post there are two major issues to address:
 The ball sometimes crosses the ground when it has a collider It is difficult to start the game. In fact, the user does not collide with the collider of the banner because of teleportation.  Today I will focus on the balls and leave the problem of starting the game for another time.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to start the project. As described previously in lab 3, I have chosen to implement the teleportation ball as my locomotion technique. Even if I know that this locomotion technique is not the most adapted for the parkour provided by the teachers I still chose to make my tests by using it.
The first step was to import the project. I didn&amp;rsquo;t encounter any problems, I simply followed the teacher&amp;rsquo;s tutorial.</description>

      <description>Lecture Homework The goal of this homework is to propose different types of locomotion techniques to naviguate in the virtual environment.
Swimming locomotion I want to design a locomotion technique that could be used in an aquatic environment. The purpose of my locomotion is to move freely in the water and enjoy the environment. It is therefore more suitable for underwater exploration games, without stress or constraints, even if we could imagine more complex scenarios (speed game where you have to escape from a shark, underwater escape game,&amp;hellip;).</description>
