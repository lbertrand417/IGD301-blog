[{"categories":null,"contents":"Roll-a-ball It\u0026rsquo;s time to create the first Unity project! The teachers initially asked us to follow the Roll-a-ball tutorial but to test other more complex tutorials in case we were already familiar with Unity. I had already used Unity for previous projects but I found that I was still very new to the software so I preferred to follow the Roll-a-ball tutorial anyway to get a good start.\nThe tutorial is mostly about following the tutorial so there is not really much to explain.","date":"2021-12-28T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://lbertrand417.github.io/IGD301-blog/blog/lab2/","tags":["Unity","VR","Tutorial","Roll-a-ball"],"title":"Second lab"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Lecture Homework The goal of this homework is to propose different types of locomotion techniques to naviguate in the virtual environment.\nSwimming locomotion I want to design a locomotion technique that could be used in an aquatic environment. The purpose of my locomotion is to move freely in the water and enjoy the environment. It is therefore more suitable for underwater exploration games, without stress or constraints, even if we could imagine more complex scenarios (speed game where you have to escape from a shark, underwater escape game,\u0026hellip;).","date":"2021-12-28T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://lbertrand417.github.io/IGD301-blog/blog/lab3/","tags":["Locomotion","VR"],"title":"Third lab"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Lecture Homework Hyper reality Mixed reality can improve a lot of tools, like google maps or, more generally, the way to present information. However, just as there are people who use technologies to do harm, mixed reality is also subject to abuse. The Hyper Reality video presents a dystopian vision of virtual reality and I will also present different problematic scenarios.\nHolo love As it is already the case with existing technologies, social networks tend to transform relationships into something virtual.","date":"2021-11-27T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://lbertrand417.github.io/IGD301-blog/blog/lab1/","tags":["Hugo","Unity","Setup"],"title":"First lab"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Written in Go, Hugo is an open source static site generator available under the Apache Licence 2.0.
