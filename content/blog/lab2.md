# Roll-a-ball

It's time to create the first Unity project! The teachers initially asked us to follow the Roll-a-ball tutorial but to test other more complex tutorials 
in case we were already familiar with Unity. I had already used Unity for previous projects but I found that I was still very new to the software so 
I preferred to follow the Roll-a-ball tutorial anyway to get a good start.

The tutorial is mostly about following the tutorial so there is not really much to explain. I'm going to tell you a little bit about the different steps to follow.
